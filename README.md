# EBS-PLSQL-Scripts
Comprehensive collection of PL/SQL scripts and Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) APIs to enhance productivity, streamline operations, and extend the functionality of Oracle EBS

Why Use EBS-PLSQL?
Oracle E-Business Suite, though powerful, often has restrictions and limited capabilities for customization directly within the application. This repository bridges those gaps by offering:

Custom PL/SQL Scripts: Directly interact with EBS data, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance productivity without relying solely on front-end tools.
EBS API Integrations: Tap into Oracle’s PL/SQL APIs to execute business logic while adhering to EBS security and data integrity standards.
